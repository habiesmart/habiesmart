[Intro: Pharrell Williams]<br>
Hey<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]<br>
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)<br>
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na<br>
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)<br>
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]<br>
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"<br>
(When he came in the room) (uh)<br>
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)<br>
(But I can't without you)<br>
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)<br>
(That summer night in June)<br>
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)<br>
He got me feelin' like...<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]<br>
Oooh-oooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him<br>
I loved him when I left him<br>
Got me feelin' like...<br>
Oooh-oooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him<br>
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]<br>
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)<br>
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
My heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
Havana, ooh na-na<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Young Thug]<br>
Jeffery<br>
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm<br>
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn (fresh out East Atlanta)<br>
Bump-bump-bump-bump her, like a traffic jam<br>
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ayy)<br>
Back it on me<br>
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (on me)<br>
She waited on me (then what?)<br>
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)<br>
This is history in the makin', on me (on me)<br>
Point blank, close range, that B<br>
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)<br>
I was gettin' mula, baby<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]<br>
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)<br>
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (oh, ayy, ayy)<br>
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh, no)<br>
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
My heart is in Havana (ayy)<br>
Havana, ooh na-na<br>
<br>

Ooh na-na, oh-na-na-na (oo-ooh)<br>
