    <h4 align=center>Sam Smith</h4>
    <h5 align=center>You must think that I'm stupid <br>
You must think that I'm a fool <br>
You must think that I'm new to this <br>
But I have seen this all before <br>
<br>
I'm never gonna let you close to me<br>
Even though you mean the most to me<br>
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br>
So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br>
Even when I mean the most to you<br>
In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br>
<br>
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br>
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br>
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br>
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br>
<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
<br>
I know you're thinking I'm heartless<br>
I know you're thinking I'm cold<br>
I'm just protecting my innocence<br>
I'm just protecting my soul<br>
<br>
I'm never gonna let you close to me<br>
Even though you mean the most to me<br>
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br>
So I'm never gonna get too close to you<br>
Even when I mean the most to you<br>
In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br>
<br>
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br>
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br>
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br>
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br>
<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
No way that you'll see me cry<br>
(No way that you'll see me cry)<br>
<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
No<br>
No, no, no, no, no<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
No, no, no<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
(No way that you'll see me cry)<br>
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>

'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br>
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br>
And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br>
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true<br>
I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
