      Oh, there she goes again br<br>
Every morning it's the same<br>
You walk on by my house<br>
I wanna call out your name<br>
<br>
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing<br>
You got me thinking what we could be 'cause...<br>
<br>
I keep craving, craving<br>
You don't know it but it's true<br>
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you<br>
This is typical of love<br>
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait<br>
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever<br>
<br>
In my dreams you're with me<br>
We'll be everything I want us to be<br>
And from there—who knows?<br>
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time<br>
Or is that just me and my imagination?<br>
<br>
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time<br>
Walking by the ocean side<br>
Our hands are gently intertwined<br>
A feeling I just can't describe<br>
All this time we spent alone<br>
Thinking we could not belong<br>
To something so damn beautiful<br>
So damn beautiful<br>
<br>
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true<br>
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you<br>
This is typical of love<br>
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait<br>
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever<br>
<br>
In my dreams you're with me<br>
We'll be everything I want us to be<br>
And from there—who knows?<br>
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time<br>
Or is that just me and my imagination?<br>
<br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
Imagination<br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
Imagination<br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
<br>
In my dreams you're with me<br>
We'll be everything I want us to be<br>
And from there—who knows?<br>
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time<br>
Or is that just me and my imagination?<br>
<br>
I keep craving, craving<br>
You don't know it, but it's true<br>
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you<br>
