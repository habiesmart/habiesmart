    <h4 align=center>Simple Plan</h4>
    <h5 align=center>
      Hey, Dad, look at me <br>
Think back, and talk to me <br>
Did I grow up according to plan? <br>
<br>
And do you think I'm wasting my time <br>
Doing things I want to do? <br>
But it hurts when you disapproved all along <br>
<br>
And now I try hard to make it <br>
I just want to make you proud <br>
I'm never gonna be good enough for <br>
You can't pretend that I'm alrigh <br>
And you can't change me <br>
<br>
'Cause we lost it all <br>
Nothin' lasts forever <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
Now it's just too late <br>
And we can't go back <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
<br>
I try not to think <br>
About the pain I feel inside <br>
Did you know you used to be my hero? <br>
<br>
All the days you spent with me <br>
Now seem so far away <br>
And it feels like you don't care any more <br>
<br>
And now I try hard to make it <br>
I just want to make you proud <br>
I'm never gonna be good enough for you <br>
I can't stand another fight <br>
And nothing's all right <br>
<br>
'Cause we lost it all <br>
Nothin' lasts forever <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
Now it's just too late <br>
And we can't go back <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
<br>
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said <br>
And nothing's gonna make this right again <br>
Please don't turn your back <br>
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you <br>
But you don't understand <br>
<br>
'Cause we lost it all <br>
Nothin' lasts forever <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
Now it's just too late <br>
And we can't go back <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
<br>
'Cause we lost it all <br>
Nothin' lasts forever <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
Now it's just too late <br>
And we can't go back <br>
I'm sorry i can't be perfect <br>
<br>
