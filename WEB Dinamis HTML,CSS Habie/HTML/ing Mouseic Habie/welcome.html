    <h5 align=center>
      Do you ever feel like breaking down? <br>
Do you ever feel out of place? <br>
Like somehow you just don't belong <br>
And no one understands you <br>
<br>
Do you ever want to run away? <br>
Do you lock yourself in your room? <br>
With the radio on turned up so loud <br>
That no one hears you screaming <br>
<br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
When nothing feels alright <br>
You don't know what its like to be like me <br>
<br>
To be hurt, to feel lost <br>
To be left out in the dark <br>
To be kicked when you're down <br>
To feel like you've been pushed around <br>
To be on the edge of breaking down <br>
And no one there to save you <br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
Welcome to my life <br>
<br>
Do you want to be somebody else? <br>
Are you sick of feeling so left out? <br>
Are you desperate to find something more <br>
Before your life is over <br>
<br>
Are you stuck inside a world you hate? <br>
Are you sick of everyone around? <br>
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies <br>
But deep inside you're bleeding <br>
<br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
When nothing feels alright <br>
You don't know what its like to be like me <br>
<br>
To be hurt, to feel lost <br>
To be left out in the dark <br>
To be kicked when you're down <br>
To feel like you've been pushed around <br>
To be on the edge of breaking down <br>
And no one there to save you <br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
Welcome to my life <br>
<br>
No one ever lied straight to your face <br>
And no one ever stabbed you in the back <br>
You might think I'm happy <br>
But I'm not gonna be okay <br>
Everybody always gave you what you wanted <br>
You never had to work it was always there <br>
You don't know what its like <br>
What it's like <br>
<br>
To be hurt, to feel lost <br>
To be left out in the dark <br>
To be kicked when you're down <br>
To feel like you've been pushed around <br>
To be on the edge of breaking down <br>
And no one there to save you <br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
What it's like <br>
<br>
To be hurt, to feel lost <br>
To be left out in the dark <br>
To be kicked when you're down <br>
To feel like you've been pushed around <br>
To be on the edge of breaking down <br>
And no one there to save you <br>
No you don't know what its like <br>
Welcome to my life <br>
Welcome to my life <br>
Welcome to my life <br>
