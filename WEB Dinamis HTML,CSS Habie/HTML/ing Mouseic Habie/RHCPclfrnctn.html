Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation <br>
Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations <br>
And if you want these kind of dreams <br>
It's Californication <br>
<br>
Is the edge of the world and all of western civilization <br>
The sun may rise in the East, at least it's settled in a finer location <br>
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication  <br>
<br>
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging <br>
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging? <br>
First-born unicorn <br>
Hardcore softporn <br>
<br> 
Dream of Californication <br>
Dream of Californication <br>
<br>
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation <br>
A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high on information <br>
And buy me a star on the Boulevard, It's Californication <br>
<br>
Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement <br>
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres <br>
Singing song off Station to Station? <br>
And Alderaan's not far away, ity's Californication <br>
<br>
(ooh ooh) <br>
(ooh ooh) <br>
<br>
(ooh ooh) Born and raise by those who praise control of population <br>
(ooh ooh) Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation <br>
(ooh ooh) First-born unicorn<br>
(ooh ooh) Hardcore softporn <br>
<br>

Destruction leads a to very rough road, but it also breeds creation <br>
And earthquakes are, to a girl's guitar <br>
They're just another good vibration <br>
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Calfornication <br>
<br>
(ooh ooh) <br>
(ooh ooh) <br>
<br>
(ooh ooh) Pay youre surgeon very well to break the spell of aging <br>
(ooh ooh) Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving <br>
(ooh ooh) First-born unicorn <br>
(ooh ooh) Hardcore softporn <br>
