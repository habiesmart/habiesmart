Yeah, I’d rather be a lover than a fighter <br>
‘Cause all my life, I’ve been fighting<br>
Never felt a feeling of comfort<br>
All this time, I’ve been hiding<br>
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah<br>
I’m so used to sharing<br>
Love only left me alone<br>
But I’m at one with the silence<br>
<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been silent for too long<br>
<br>
I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
<br>
I’m in need of a savior, but I’m not asking for favors<br>
My whole life, I’ve felt like a burden<br>
I think too much, and I hate it<br>
I’m so used to being in the wrong, I’m tired of caring<br>
Loving never gave me a home, so I’ll sit here in the silence<br>
<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been silent for too long<br>
<br>
I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
I found peace in your violence<br>
Can’t tell me there’s no point in trying<br>
I’m at one, and I’ve been quiet for too long<br>
