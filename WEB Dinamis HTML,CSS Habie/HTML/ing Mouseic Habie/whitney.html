      Share my life, take me for what I am <br>
      'Cause I'll never change all my colours for you <br>
      Take my love, I'll never ask for too much <br>
      Just all that you are and everything that you do <br>
       <br>
      I don't really need to look very much further <br>
      I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow <br>
      I won't hold it back again, this passion inside <br>
      Can't run from myself <br>
      There's nowhere to hide <br>
       <br>
      Don't make me close one more door <br>
      I don't wanna hurt anymore <br>
      Stay in my arms if you dare <br>
      Or must I imagine you there <br>
      Don't walk away from me... <br>
      I have nothing, nothing, nothing <br>
      If I don't have you, you, you, you, you. <br>
       <br>
      You see through right to the heart of me <br>
      You break down my walls with the strength of your love<br>
      I never knew love like I've known it with you <br>
      Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to <br>
       <br>
      I don't really need to look very much further <br>
      I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow <br>
      I won't hold it back again, this passion inside <br>
      I can't run from myself <br>
      There's nowhere to hide <br>
      Your love I'll remember forever <br>
       <br>
      Don't make me close one more door <br>
      I don't wanna hurt anymore <br>
      Stay in my arms if you dare <br>
      Or must I imagine you there <br>
      Don't walk away from me... <br>
      I have nothing, nothing, nothing... <br>
       <br>
      Don't make me close one more door <br>
      I don't wanna hurt anymore <br>
      Stay in my arms if you dare <br>
      Or must I imagine you there <br>
      Don't walk away from me, no. <br>
      Don't walk away from me <br>
      Don't you dare walk away from me <br>
      I have nothing, nothing, nothing <br>
      If I don't have you, you, <br>
      If I don't have you, oh, ooh, ooh. <br>
