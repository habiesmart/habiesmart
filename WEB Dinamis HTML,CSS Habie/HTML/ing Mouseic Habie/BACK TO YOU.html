[Bebe Rexha:<br>
I know you say you know me, know me well<br>
But these days I don't even know myself, no<br>
I always thought I'd be with someone else<br>
I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah<br>
<br>
I call you but you never even answer<br>
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games<br>
But then I get so numb with all the laughter<br>
That I forget about the pain<br>
<br>
Whoah, you stress me out, you kill me<br>
You drag me down, you fuck me up<br>
We're on the ground, we're screaming<br>
I don't know how to make it stop<br>
I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it<br>
But I keep on coming back to you<br>
<br>
[Louis Tomlinson:]<br>
I know my friends they give me bad advice<br>
Like move on, get you out my mind<br>
But don't you think I haven't even tried<br>
You got me cornered and my hands are tied<br>
<br>
[Louis Tomlinson & Bebe Rexha:]<br>
You got me so addicted to the drama<br>
I tell myself I'm done with wicked games<br>
But then I get so numb with all the laughter<br>
That I forget about the pain<br>
<br>
[Louis Tomlinson:]<br>
Whoah, you stress me out, you kill me<br>
You drag me down, you fuck me up<br>
We're on the ground, we're screaming<br>
I don't know how to make it stop<br>
I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it<br>
But I keep on coming back to you (back to you)<br>
Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you (back to you)<br>
Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you<br>
<br>
And I guess you'll never know<br>
All the bullshit that you put me through<br>
And I guess you'll never know, no<br>
<br>
[Bebe Rexha & Louis Tomlinson:]<br>
Yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder<br>
You can be the pill to ease the pain<br>
'Cause I know I'm addicted to your drama<br>
Baby, here we go again<br>
<br>
Whoah, you stress me out, you kill me<br>
You drag me down, you fuck me up<br>
We're on the ground, we're screaming<br>
I don't know how to make it stop<br>
I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it<br>
But I keep on coming back to you (back to you)<br>
Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you (back to you)<br>
Oh, no, no, I just keep on coming back to you<br>
Back to you<br>
I just keep on coming back to you<br>
