      I see those tears in your eyes <br>
I feel so helpless inside <br>
Oh love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
<br>
Cold hands, red eyes <br>
Packed your bags at midnight <br>
They've been there for weeks <br>
You don't know what goodbye means <br>
<br>
Just roll up a cigarette <br>
Just forget about this mess <br>
Waiting on the sidelines <br>
From the sidelines <br>
<br>
I see those tears in your eyes <br>
And i feel so helpless inside <br>
Oh love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
If your ghost pulls you up high <br>
And it feels like you've lost who you are <br>
My love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
<br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
<br>
And you whisper, I'm alright <br>
But I see through your white lies <br>
But these walls don’t talk <br>
And if they could, they’d say <br>
<br>
Can't hide the secrets <br>
You can't forget about this mess <br>
I'm waiting on the sidelines <br>
From the sidelines <br>
<br>
I see those tears in your eyes <br>
And i feel so helpless inside <br>
Oh love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
If your ghost pulls you up high <br>
And it feels like you've lost who you are <br>
My love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
<br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
<br>
I see those tears in your eyes <br>
And i feel so helpless inside <br>
Oh love, there's no need to hide <br>
Just let me love you when your heart is tired <br>
