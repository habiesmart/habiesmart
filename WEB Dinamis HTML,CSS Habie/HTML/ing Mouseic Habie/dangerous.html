      Oh, yeah <br>
      <br>
      Don't need permission<br>
      Made my decision to test my limits<br>
      'Cause it's my business, God as my witness<br>
      Start what I finished<br>
      Don't need no hold up<br>
      Taking control of this kind of moment<br>
      I'm locked and loaded<br>
      Completely focused, my mind is open<br>
      <br>

      Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman<br>
      Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you<br>
      Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't<br>
      Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout<br>
      <br>
      Nothing to prove and<br>
      I'm bulletproof and<br>
      Know what I'm doing<br>
      The way we're movin' like introducing<br>
      Us to a new thing<br>
      I wanna savor, save it for later<br>
      The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker<br>
      'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature<br>
      I live for danger<br>
      <br>
      All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God<br>
      Don't ya stop, boy<br>
      <br>
      Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman<br>
      Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you<br>
