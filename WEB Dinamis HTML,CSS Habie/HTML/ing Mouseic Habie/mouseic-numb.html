      I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
      Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
      Don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
      Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes <br>
      (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
      Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
      (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
      <br>
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
      Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
      I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
      Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
      <br>
      Can't you see that you're smothering me, <br>
      Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control? <br>
      'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
      Has fallen apart right in front of you. <br>
      (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
      Every step that I take is another mistake to you. <br>
      (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
      And every second I waste is more than I can take. <br>
      <br>
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
      Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
      I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
      Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
      <br>
      And I know <br>
      I may end up failing too. <br>
      But I know <br>
      You were just like me with someone disappointed in you. <br>
      <br>
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there, <br>
      Become so tired, so much more aware. <br>
      I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
      Is be more like me and be less like you. <br>
      <br>
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there. <br>
      (I'm tired of being what you want me to be) <br>
      I've become so numb, I can't feel you there. <br>
      (I'm tired of being what you want me to be) <br>
