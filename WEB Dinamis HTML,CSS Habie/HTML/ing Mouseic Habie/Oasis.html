How many special people change? <br>
How many lives are living strange? <br>
Where were you while we were getting high? <br>
<br>
slowly waling down the hall <br>
faster than a cannonball <br>
Where were you while we were getting high? <br>
<br>
Someday you will find me <br>
Caught beneath the landslide <br>
In a champagne supernova in the sky <br>
<br>
Someday you will find me <br>
Caught beneath the landslide <br>
In a champagne supernova <br>
A champagne supernova in the sky <br> 
<br>
Wake up the dawn and ask her why <br>
A dreamer dreams, she never dies <br>
Wipe that tear away now from your eye <br>
<br>
Slowly walking down the hall <br>
Faster than a cannonball <br>
Where were you while we were getting high? <br>
<br>
Someday you will find me <br>
Caught beneath the landslide <br>
In a champagne supernova in the sky <br>
<br>
Someday you will find me <br>
Caught beneath the landslide <br>
In a champagne supernova <br>
A champagne supernova in the sky <br>
<br>
'Cuz we don't believe<br>
That they're gonna get away from the summer <br>
But you and I will never die <br>
The world's still spinning around we don't know why <br>
Why-why-why-why-i-i <br>
<br>
