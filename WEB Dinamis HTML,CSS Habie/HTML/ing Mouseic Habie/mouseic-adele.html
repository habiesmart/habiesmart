      Everybody loves the things you do <br>
      From the way you talk to the way you move <br>
      Everybody here is watching you <br>
      'Cause you feel like home <br>
      You're like a dream come true <br>
      <br>
      But if by change you're here along <br>
      Can i have a moment before i go? <br>
      'Cause I've been by myself all night long <br>
      Hoping you're someone I used to know <br>
      <br>
      You look like a movie <br>
      You sound like a song <br>
      My God, this reminds me <br>
      Of when we were young <br>
      <br>
      Let me photograph you in this light <br>
      In case it is the last time <br>
That we might be exactly like we were <br>
Before we realized <br>
We were sad of getting old <br>
It made us restless <br>
It was just like a movie <br>
It was just like a song <br>
<br>
I was so scared to face my fears <br>
Nobody told me that you'd be here <br>
And I swear you moved overseas <br>
That's what you said, when you left me <br>
<br>
You still look like a movie <br>
You still sound like a song <br>
My God, this reminds me <br>
Of when we were young <br>
<br>
Let me photograph you in this light <br>
In case it is the last time <br>
That we might be exactly like we were <br>
Before we realized <br>
We were sad of getting old <br>
It made us restless <br>
It was just like a movie <br>
It was just like a song <br>
<br>
When we were young [4x] <br>
<br>
It's hard to admit that <br>
Everything just takes me back <br>
To when you were there <br>
To when you were there <br>
And a part of me keeps holding on <br>
Just in case it hasn't gone <br>
I guess I still care <br>
Do you still care? <br>
<br>
It was just like a movie <br>
It was just like a song <br>
My God, this reminds me <br>
Of when we were young <br>
<br>
When we were young [4x] <br>
<br>
Let me photograph you in this light <br>
In case it is the last time <br>
That we might be exactly like we were <br>
Before we realized <br>
We were sad of getting old <br>
It made us restless <br>
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old <br>
It makes me reckless <br>
It was just like a movie <br>
It was just like a song <br>
When we were young <br>
