      I used to be so happy <br>
      But without you here I feel so low <br>
      I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go <br>
      'Cause once upon a time you were my everything <br>
      It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing <br>
      It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know <br>
      <br>
      I will never forget you <br>
      You'll always be by my side <br>
      From the day that I met you <br>
      I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die <br>
      And I will never want much more <br>
      And in my heart I will always be sure <br>
      I will never forget you <br>
      And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die <br>
      <br>
      'Til the day I die ('til the day I die) <br>
      'Til the day I die ('til the day I die) <br>
      <br>
      Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright <br>
      I wonder what would happen <br>
      If we went back and put up a fight <br>
      'Cause once upon a time you were my everything <br>
      It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing <br>
      So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind (take you off my mind) <br>
      <br>
      I will never forget you <br>
      And you'll always be by my side <br>
      From the day that I met you <br>
      I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die <br>
      And I will never want much more <br>
      And in my heart I will always be sure <br>
      I will never forget you <br>
      And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die <br> <br>
       <br>
      Feeling it, loving it <br>
      Everything that we do <br>
      And all along, I knew I had something special with you <br>
      But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through <br>
      But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you <br>
       <br>
